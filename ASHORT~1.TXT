

    So my project is based on the idea of arranging books about skincare in a shelf of a bookstore. 


    Basically, arranging the books in a shelf and the books are about skincare. 

    This section of code refers to the Data / Information provided regarding the book:

    " 
    public Book (String name, String bookType, LocalDate publishedDate, double price, String authorName, String brand, String tag ){
        this.name = name;
        this.bookType = bookType;
        this.publishedDate = publishedDate;
        this.price = price;
        this.authorName = authorName;
        this.brand = brand;
        this.tag = tag; ( the tag is whether the book was purchased or not and if customers are interested in the product or not)
		                                      "
											  
											  
		
    Overall, 12 test cases has been created that runs successfully.
